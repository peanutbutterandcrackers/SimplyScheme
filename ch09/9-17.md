##### 9.17  Write keep in terms of every and accumulate.

###### In terms of `every`:
```Scheme
(define (keep pred sent)
  (every (lambda (w) (if (pred w) w '())) sent))
```

###### In terms of `accumulate`:
```Scheme
(define (keep pred sent)
  (accumulate (lambda (x y)
               (let ( (f (lambda (i) (if (sentence? i) i (or (and (pred i) i) '())))) )
                (sentence (f x) (f y))
               )
              ) sent))
```
